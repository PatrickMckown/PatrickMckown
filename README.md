# Welcome!
Hello! I'm Patrick Mckown, and I have a deep passion for supply chain management and data analytics. Over the past seven years, I have honed my skills in this field, focusing particularly on the data analytics side.

## About Me
* Supply Chain Management: My professional journey has been centered around optimizing and improving various aspects of supply chain management. This includes vendor performance, OTIF (On-Time In Full), distribution management, and more.
* Data Analytics: I am proficient in Excel, and have extended my skills to SQL and Python. My goal is to leverage these tools to create valuable resources and queries that can enhance supply chain management practices.
* Teaching and Resources: I am currently working on building resources to teach SQL to students who have a background in Excel, making the transition smoother and more intuitive.

## Current Projects
* Supply Chain Analytics Resources: Developing comprehensive resources that demonstrate the use of Excel, SQL, and Python in analyzing and improving supply chain processes.
* SQL for Excel Users: Creating tutorials and guides that help students with an Excel background learn SQL, bridging the gap between these two powerful tools.

## Personal Interests
* Personal Finance: Outside of my professional interests, I am also passionate about personal finance. I am developing various resources aimed at helping individuals take control of their personal finances, empowering them to make informed financial decisions.

Feel free to explore my repositories and projects. I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, and discussions!
